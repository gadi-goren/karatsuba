# karatsuba
This repository explores the Karatsuba multiplication algorithm and compares it to other algorithims.

It contains a [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/gadi-goren/karatsuba/blob/main/notebooks/karatsuba_multiply.ipynb) that demonstrates these algorithims. The notebook can be run on both Google Colab, here in GitHub Codespaces and also on a local machine.

## Run on Colab

Click the badge below to open the notebook on Google Colab:
